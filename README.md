Hi everybody.

# Getting Started

Yes, I know it. It's not a real problem or a case that desires much attention. And yes, it is a problem with hundreds of thousands of solutions available across the internet. But just a few of them show and explain the brainstorming process necessary to develop and test new features, which consumes the most part of the avaiable time of any Data Scientist (you may know if you have any experience with ML). You can find the data and all further information here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques


I think the best way to transform any non-linear problem into a linear one is to break it into pieces.
That's why I aimed 3 main objectives here:

1. Introduce every intuitive and gentle way to construct Machine Learning Models using common tools, such as sklearn;
1. Using the most amazing and iterative visualization tools that you can find on the internet.
1. Create a pipeline of ideas and insights of features, where you can see what we've thought before proposing any new feature;

 Luckly, it will give you some insights for your next challenge!


 See you around, guys.


 Ciao.
